# Antiques

This is a draft for an antique trade database called antique_glass specialising on glasware.
The code is written in SQL for training purposes.

The database contains two tables and can be extended further. 
The first table "vases" encloses only items categorised as glass vases, listing their properties such as size and weight, maker etc with item_id as the Primary Key and sellers_Id as the Foreign Key.

With the sellers_Id as the Primary Key, the second table "traders" includes names and details of the different traders offering their glassware antiques for sale. 

Entries on this database are entirely fictional and only for the purpose of illustrating the structure and function of the database.
